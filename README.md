# Cloud-Native Backend exposing a GraphQL API.
This is my humble try to implement a GraphQL backend using https://github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go. Here I will document  what I find out and how I set things up.

## Setup
Assuming you have a working go installation, navigate into gopath/src/github.com/<username>/ and clone this repository:

## API
### GraphQL

## Kubernetes
### Docker/Compose
